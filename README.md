# ⚙️ Predictive Maintenance System for Industrial Motors and Pumps (IIoT-based)

A modern industrial environment relies on the continuous, efficient operation of critical assets such as pumps and motors. Unexpected equipment failures can lead to costly downtime and productivity losses. This project implements an **Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based Predictive Maintenance (PdM) system** for monitoring and predicting potential failures in industrial motors and pumps.

The system uses real-time sensor data acquisition, analytics, and cloud connectivity to detect anomalies and send alerts, helping industries move from reactive to predictive, data-driven maintenance strategies.

## 📋 Working Principle

1. **Temperature and voltage sensors** continuously monitor the motor/pump.
2. The microcontroller reads these values at regular intervals.
3. Data is processed locally to check if readings cross set threshold limits.
4. If abnormal values are detected:
   - A **buzzer/relay** triggers a local alert.
   - Data is uploaded to a **cloud server (ThingSpeak/MQTT/Blynk)** for logging and remote monitoring.
5. **Trend analysis and anomaly detection** are performed to predict possible failures before they occur.
6. **Preventive maintenance alerts** help minimize unplanned downtime.
